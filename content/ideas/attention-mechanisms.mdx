The transformer architecture's self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length. For edge deployment — where memory and compute budgets are measured in megabytes and milliseconds — this is a fundamental bottleneck.

## The Quadratic Wall

A standard transformer processing a 512-token sequence requires approximately 1M attention computations per layer. At 2048 tokens, this explodes to 16M. For real-time edge inference on mobile devices, this is often untenable.

Several approaches have emerged to address this:

**Linear Attention** replaces softmax attention with kernel approximations, achieving O(n) complexity. However, the quality degradation on long-range dependencies remains significant for many practical tasks.

**Sparse Attention** patterns (like those in Longformer and BigBird) reduce computation by attending only to local windows and selected global tokens. This works well for document-level tasks but requires careful pattern design.

**State Space Models** (Mamba, S4) offer an alternative paradigm entirely, replacing attention with structured state transitions that achieve O(n) scaling with strong long-range modeling.

## Our Approach: Adaptive Sparse Attention

We propose a learned sparsity pattern that adapts to the input distribution. Rather than using fixed attention windows, the model learns which token pairs are worth computing attention for, based on a lightweight scoring function.

The scoring function operates in a compressed representation space, requiring only O(n log n) computation to determine the attention pattern, which then computes a sparse O(n k) attention where k is the average number of attended tokens.

## Edge Deployment Results

On a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM):
- Standard attention: 340ms per inference (512 tokens)
- Our adaptive sparse: 47ms per inference (512 tokens)
- Quality retention: 97.3% of full attention performance on benchmark tasks

The key insight is that most attention heads learn highly structured patterns that can be efficiently approximated. The remaining unstructured attention is where the model's true representational power lies, and this typically involves only 10-15% of all possible token pairs.
